# Progress Log

## 2026-03-18
- Started M4 execution task for the 1000-row layered smoke input.
- Created `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Ran direct `llm_ping` successfully with the provided LLM credentials.
- Ran exact-input preflight and full pipeline attempts; both short-circuited at connectivity inside `run_smoke_pipeline.py`.
- Older full run on a related 1000-row artifact reached translation and QA Hard, then failed with `85` QA errors and `Translated 1002 / 1003 rows`.
