# Task Plan

## Goal
Run M4 preflight and full on `data/smoke_runs/inputs/test_input_1000_smoke_layered.csv`, then capture run paths, manifests, issues, and blocking points for mainline cleanup.

## Scope
- Use `main_worktree` only.
- Record `run_id`, manifest path, issue report path, verify report path, and any row/placeholder/tag mismatches.
- Focus on `string_id=305833`, translate row counts, and `row_checks`.

## Phases
- [complete] Phase 1: Initialize plan files and inspect run entrypoints.
- [complete] Phase 2: Run `llm_ping` and preflight.
- [complete] Phase 3: Run full.
- [in_progress] Phase 4: Summarize outputs and block points.

## Notes
- Do not change implementation unless a blocking issue requires it.
- Keep the report anchored to absolute local paths.

## Run IDs collected
- `smoke_run_20260318_044314`
- `smoke_run_20260318_044327`
- `smoke_run_20260318_044415`
